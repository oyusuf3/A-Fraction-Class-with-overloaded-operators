# A-Fraction-Class-with-overloaded-operators
For this assignment, you will develop a C++ class called Fraction.   Your class will provide a wide range of functions for handling fractions.   Your project will consist of a header file fraction.h (provided), a fraction.cpp file which contains the implementation,  an exception class named  FractionException,  a driver program called driver.cpp, and a makefile.    You are responsible for writing the fraction.cpp class the fraction_exception.h class, and the driver.cpp program which will demonstrate that your program functions correctly, and a makefile to compile your project.  You must implement all of the prototypes specified in the header file.  Thus, the project consists of:

fraction.h    head file provided.
fraction.cpp    implementation of the Fraction class.
fraction_exception.h    The exception class.
driver.cpp    A driver program to demonstrate that your Fraction class works correctly.
makefile        The Makefile to compile your project.  Your Makefile must include the following flags:   -g -std=c++11 -O3 -Wall -Wpointer-arith -Wcast-qual -Wwrite-strings
